Version Control is a system that allows developers to keep a record of changes
of whatever code they wrote. It allows developers to manage events, meaning that they can know 
who made the changes and when, also, in case of a mistake, they can go back to
a previous version of the code.

One of its advantages is that when working on a team, developers 
can make changes to the code while avoiding overwriting other people's code.

An example of version control could be when you make a change to your code in
a local environment; If you want your team to have the new version, you will have
to upload the new code to the web. Github is a good place to store repositories/projects.
If using Git Bash, you will have to use the following commands (Assuming the file you changed
is called index.html):

git add index.html // Add the file to the stage area to be ready for a commit
git status (optional just to make sure everything is good) // Check the status/changes in the project. You can use it to make sure the changes were added
git commit -m "Add search feature to navBar" // This basically adds a custom message about the changes that were made
git push // This is the final step to push your changes to the web, in this example, Github, so that your whole team can then pull those changes
